0,유투브에서 봤던 큐브 리뷰 중에 제일 좋네요~ 3세대 오너 인데 잘 봤어요~ 단점도 있지만 분명 매력적인 차량 입니다~ ^^,2
1,혹시 보험료가 외제차로 빠져서 비싸나요?차가 너무 예뻐서 바꿀까 고민중인데욤^^,2
2,좋은정보네요 혹시 부품은 구하기 쉬운가요?,2
3,이거 너무 연식이ㅜ오래되서 중고차 탈만할까요?  수리비가 더드는거 아닐가 망설여지네요  ...ㅎㅎ,2
4,닛산 큐브 친구가 처음으로 탔던 차량 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 우핸들이라 너무 불편했어욬ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 그리고 1년만에 레이 타다 또 1년만에 cla 이렇게 넘어가더라구요! 저 또한 5gt 가솔린 오나 로써 쌀롱님 영상 기달립니다 ㅎㅎ 쥐티도 많이 올려주세요!,2

7,I do like Elgrand conversions and this is a great example of how to do a great conversion.,10
8,"Great camper van conversion. Looks very high quality. Website is lovely, with further photos of more conversions. ",4
9,"Love the look of your van build! Also I own a 2007 Elgrand Autech and hoping to add to it.  Just 2 issues but it's just my opinion and I've liked the video. 19inch rims will be a bit uncomfortable for long traveling, also if you have passengers all the way in the back, it will be a painful ride. The seats just behind the drivers are the best but I do understand the build and it makes, space sense, to build it as you have but the build quality is beautiful!!!",2
10,This is one of the best conversions if not the best I’ve seen .Does anyone know of anywhere in Australia that does the Elgrand conversion of this high quality?I’m in Victoria but Happy to travel Thank you in advance .,3
11,Looks bloody awesome,2
12,Would anyone know how long is the elgrand inside from the tailgate to the back of the driver seat ? Many thanks,3
13,When you do the conversions for the E51 do the additional fixtures/furniture come within the maximum load weight or are there modifications/upgrades needed for the suspension? Do you know what the maximum load weight is for these vehicles?,2
14,Nice job.,2
15,Lovely looks like a quality job ,4
16,The UK has the best campers!,3
17,"Great Conversion do you do other options ,such as rear Kitchen with bench seats ....",2
18,"Dan, the bed size is let’s just say economical. A single is 36” wide. This bed in the Elgrand is just 42”. After owning a VW California SE I’d say two people wouldn’t get a decent nights sleep. Just saying. I do have to say though, the conversion is stunning.",4

42,Where can I get the splitter and other body kit from?,1
43,Coooool,1
44,Could not watch it all because of the background music.,2
45,"Rock n roll bed not as good as a rib bed because access to storage beneath is not as good and you are sleeping on the seat contoured side, instead of the much better flat other side as with a rib bed, also narrow bed instead of a wider more comfortable bed and less cupboard width would be better. Remember the wider the bed, the more storage beneath to compensate for cupboard loss. You can't compensate for a narrow uncomfortable bed.",1
46,How to replace start motor,1
47,Nice test drive. I always liked these but now I really want one.,4

I could go on but you get the idea! As to be expected the fuel consumption is not good, I’m on first name terms with the staff at my local petrol stations, sgShe had to go.......",1

53,"My dad is currently driving the same car with 2.5L V6. But I have one question. How to reset the tiptronic transmission? Because when he was driving, I wanted to shift it up manually on my own so I asked my dad to pedal to the medal and I shifted at 6,000rpm from the first gear to the forth gear. After shifting like that, the car automatically shift up at 6,000rpm even it is in manual mode. Anyone who can help me ?? Please I need to know fast .",1
